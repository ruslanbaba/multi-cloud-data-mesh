### üéØ **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED**

#### **1. Hard-coded Credentials and Secrets** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Files Affected:**
- `gcp-cost-optimization/main.tf`
- `aws-intelligent-tiering/main.tf`
- `environments/prod/variables.tf`
- `envs/dev/terraform.tfvars.example`
- `envs/prod/terraform.tfvars.example`

**Issues Found:**
```hcl
# VULNERABLE:
email_address = "cost-alerts@example.com"
endpoint = "cost-alerts@example.com" 
default = "data-ops@example.com"
bigquery_connection_principal_arn = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/..."
```

**Security Fix:**
```hcl
# SECURE:
email_address = var.notification_email
endpoint = var.notification_email
# Proper validation and no defaults
validation {
  condition = can(regex("^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$", var.notification_email))
  error_message = "Must be a valid email address."
}
```

#### **2. Excessive IAM Permissions** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Modules Affected:**
- `gcp-cost-optimization`
- `gcp-lineage`
- `gcp-mlops`

**Over-privileged Roles Identified:**
```hcl
# VULNERABLE:
"roles/bigquery.admin"
"roles/storage.admin"
"roles/datacatalog.admin"
"roles/datalineage.admin"
```

**Security Fix - Principle of Least Privilege:**
```hcl
# SECURE:
"roles/bigquery.user"              # Downgraded from admin
"roles/storage.objectAdmin"        # Specific bucket access only
"roles/datacatalog.viewer"         # Read-only access
"roles/datalineage.viewer"         # Read-only access

# Plus custom roles with minimal permissions
resource "google_project_iam_custom_role" "limited_access" {
  permissions = [
    "bigquery.reservations.create",
    "bigquery.assignments.create",
    # Only necessary permissions listed
  ]
}
```

#### **3. Missing Input Validation** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Files Affected:** All module `variables.tf` files

**Issues Found:**
```hcl
# VULNERABLE:
variable "project_id" { type = string }
variable "kms_key_id" { type = string }
variable "environment" { type = string }
```

**Security Fix:**
```hcl
# SECURE:
variable "project_id" {
  validation {
    condition = can(regex("^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{4,28}[a-z0-9]$", var.project_id))
    error_message = "Project ID must be 6-30 characters, lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only."
  }
}

variable "kms_key_id" {
  sensitive = true
  validation {
    condition = can(regex("^projects/.+/locations/.+/keyRings/.+/cryptoKeys/.+$", var.kms_key_id))
    error_message = "KMS key ID must be in full resource name format."
  }
}
```

#### **4. Insecure Network Configuration** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Module:** `gcp-lineage` (GKE cluster)

**Issues Found:**
```hcl
# VULNERABLE:
resource "google_container_cluster" "atlas_cluster" {
  # No private cluster configuration
  # No network policies
  # No shielded nodes
}
```

**Security Fix:**
```hcl
# SECURE:
resource "google_container_cluster" "atlas_cluster" {
  private_cluster_config {
    enable_private_nodes = true
    enable_private_endpoint = var.environment == "prod" ? true : false
  }
  network_policy { enabled = true }
  enable_shielded_nodes = true
  master_auth {
    client_certificate_config {
      issue_client_certificate = false
    }
  }
}
```

#### **5. Time-based Access Controls Missing** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**All IAM Role Assignments**

**Security Fix:**
```hcl
# SECURE: Added conditional access with expiration
resource "google_project_iam_member" "secure_access" {
  condition {
    title = "Time-based access restriction"
    description = "Access expires on specified date for security"
    expression = "request.time < timestamp('2026-12-31T23:59:59Z')"
  }
}
```
