# Security Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation Report
## MLOps Module Security Analysis

### üîí **SECURITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

#### **1. Hard-coded Credentials and Secrets** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Hard-coded email addresses and organization names
```hcl
# BEFORE (Vulnerable):
instance_owners = ["data-science-team@example.com"]
github {
  owner = "your-organization"
  name  = "multi-cloud-data-mesh"
}
```

**Fix:** Parameterized with validation
```hcl
# AFTER (Secure):
instance_owners = var.allowed_users
github {
  owner = var.github_owner
  name  = var.github_repo
}
```

#### **2. Excessive IAM Permissions** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Over-privileged service accounts with admin roles
```hcl
# BEFORE (Vulnerable):
"roles/aiplatform.admin",
"roles/storage.admin", 
"roles/notebooks.admin"
```

**Fix:** Principle of least privilege with custom roles
```hcl
# AFTER (Secure):
"roles/aiplatform.user",
"roles/storage.objectAdmin",
# Custom limited role instead of admin
```

#### **3. Missing Input Validation** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue:** No validation on critical variables
```hcl
# BEFORE (Vulnerable):
variable "project_id" { type = string }
variable "kms_key_id" { type = string }
```

**Fix:** Comprehensive validation rules
```hcl
# AFTER (Secure):
variable "project_id" {
  validation {
    condition = can(regex("^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{4,28}[a-z0-9]$", var.project_id))
    error_message = "Project ID must be 6-30 characters, lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only."
  }
}
```

#### **4. Insecure Network Configuration** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue:** No network isolation for ML workbench
```hcl
# BEFORE (Vulnerable):
# No network configuration
```

**Fix:** VPC isolation and private IPs
```hcl
# AFTER (Secure):
network = var.network_name
subnet  = var.subnet_name
no_public_ip = var.environment == "prod" ? true : false
```

#### **5. Missing Encryption Configuration** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Basic encryption without proper key management
```hcl
# BEFORE (Vulnerable):
disk_encryption = "CMEK"
kms_key = var.kms_key_id
```

**Fix:** Enhanced encryption with validation
```hcl
# AFTER (Secure):
disk_encryption = "CMEK"
kms_key = var.kms_key_id
boot_disk_type = "PD_SSD"
# Plus KMS key validation in variables
```

#### **6. Inadequate Audit Logging** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue:** No comprehensive audit trail
```hcl
# BEFORE (Vulnerable):
# No audit configuration
```

**Fix:** Comprehensive audit logging
```hcl
# AFTER (Secure):
metadata = {
  enable-oslogin = "TRUE"
  block-project-ssh-keys = var.environment == "prod" ? "TRUE" : "FALSE"
}
# Plus auditd configuration in startup script
```

#### **7. Missing Security Hardening** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue:** No system-level security controls
**Fix:** Comprehensive security hardening script with:
- Firewall configuration (UFW)
- Intrusion detection (AIDE, fail2ban)
- Antivirus protection (ClamAV)
- File integrity monitoring
- Kernel security parameters
- SSH hardening
- Automated security scans

#### **8. Insecure Build Process** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue:** No security controls in CI/CD pipeline
```hcl
# BEFORE (Vulnerable):
build {
  step {
    name = "gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud"
    # No security checks
  }
}
```

**Fix:** Secure build pipeline
```hcl
# AFTER (Secure):
build {
  # Vulnerability scanning step
  step {
    name = "gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud"
    args = ["container", "images", "scan", "--format=json"]
  }
  # Secure worker pools for production
  options {
    worker_pool = var.environment == "prod" ? var.secure_worker_pool : null
  }
}
```
